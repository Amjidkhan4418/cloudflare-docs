When you edit an application version, Cloudflare updates the zone configuration settings associated with that version. You can only update the configuration settings associated with your most recent version.

To edit the zone configuration settings for a version:

1. Log into the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/login).
2. Select your account.
3. Go to **HTTP Applications**.
4. Select an existing application.
5. On a specific version, click **Edit**
6. Adjust your zone configuration settings (any changes you make are saved automatically).
7. To leave **Edit** mode, click the back arrow next to **HTTP Applications** in your navigation menu.
