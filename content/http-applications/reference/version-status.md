# Version status

When you create a [new application](/http-applications/how-to/manage-applications-and-versions/#create-new-http-application) or [application version](/http-applications/how-to/manage-applications-and-versions/#create-new-version-of-application), the created version of your application can have one of two statuses:

| Status | Next steps |
| --- | --- |
| ✅ | None required |
| ❌ | TBD, something about **Retry Clone**? |
